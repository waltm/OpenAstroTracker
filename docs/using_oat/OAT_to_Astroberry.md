# **Connecting Arduino based OAT to Astroberry Server.**

This guide assumes you have Astroberry installed on a Raspberry Pi and you are able to access the desktop. (See [Astroberry Quick Start Guide](https://www.astroberry.io/docs/index.php?title=Astroberry_Server#Quick_Start "Astroberry Quick Start Guide") for Astroberry setup.)



---
OAT Arduino must have either **SUPPORTS_SERIAL** or **HEADLESS_CLIENT** enabled.

***

1. Connect OAT and cameras to Raspberry Pi  


2. Launch KStars from the main menu bar or Applications -> Education -> KStars menu

3. Under "Select Profile" click the Add Profile button  
   ![Create Profile](../Astroberry_Connect/Create_Profile.png)  

   
4. Enter a name for your new profile.  Select "LX200 GPS" for your Mount, your imaging camera driver for "CCD" and either "V4L2 CCD" or "INDI Webcam" for your Guider.  
   
   NOTE: Try the V4L2 driver first as it has more settable options for the webcam. If "INDI Webcam" is not in the list of drivers, it can be installed by opening a terminal window and typing "sudo apt-get install INDI-webcam"
